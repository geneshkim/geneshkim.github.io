I'm a senior at Stanford University studying [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Accessibility. I'll be graduating in December 2024 and am actively applying to PhD programs in computer science and HCI this cycle. I strive to make both using and developing cutting-edge technology more accessible for Blind and Low-Vision people through computing research. Currently, my research interests are in accessible data visualization, STEM education, digital design/personal fabrication tools, and haptics.
In my undergrad, I've had the honor of learning from and collaborating with many expert HCI researchers, including [Sean Follmer](https://profiles.stanford.edu/sean-follmer) of [Shape Lab](https://shape.stanford.edu/), [Jennifer Mankoff](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/jmankoff) of [Make4all](https://make4all.org/), [Sheri Sheppard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheri_D._Sheppard) of the [Designing Education Lab](<https://del.stanford.edu/), [Jacob Wobbrock](https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/) of [ACE Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/), [Megan Hofmann](https://www.megan-hofmann.com/) of [ACT Lab](https://actlab.sites.northeastern.edu/research/), and most recently, [Pedro Lopes](https://plopes.org/) from the [Human-Computer Integration lab](https://lab.plopes.org/). I've published five full papers and four short papers/posters at top tier, peer reviewed research venues including [ACM SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org/), [ACM ASSETS](https://dl.acm.org/conference/assets), and [TACCESS](https://dl.acm.org/journal/taccess). This includes one best paper honorable mention.
I'm also a proud disability advocate. During my three years serving on the [National Association of Blind Students](https://nabslink.org/) board of directors, I traveled to 13 states across the country to host blind student empowerment seminars, help teach non-visual STEM and college readiness skills, and public speak about my own journey as a person with a disability. Every January, you can find me meeting with legislators on capital hill to advocate for important disability legislation, including the [Websites and Software Applications accessibility act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4998). I also co-founded and oversee an international mentorship program for young blind professionals in STEM.

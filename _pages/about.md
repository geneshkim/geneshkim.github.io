## Welcome to my website!
I'm a first year Ph.D. student at [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) exploring how multisensory data representations can empower engineers and designers. Put it simply, I think deeply about the ways humans perceive complex information, how our perception can be augmented, and how all this can make it easier for everyday people to build cool stuff. 

I conduct research at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) under the guidance of my advisors, [Arvind Satyanaryan](https://arvindsatya.com/) in the [Visualization Group](https://vis.csail.mit.edu/) and [Jas Brooks](https://jasbrooks.net/) in the Perceptual Engineering Group. I'm open to summer industry research internships.

Previously, I completed my B.S. (with honors) in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Accessibility at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), being advised by [Sean Follmer](https://profiles.stanford.edu/sean-follmer). Throughout my undergrad, I was very fortunate to work with many incredible HCI researchers, including [Pedro Lopes](https://plopes.org/), [Megan Hofmann](https://www.megan-hofmann.com/), [Jennifer Mankoff](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/jmankoff), [Sheri Sheppard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheri_D._Sheppard), and [Jacob Wobbrock](https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/). These collaborations lead to 10 peer-reviewed full publications and 4 peer-reviewed posters at the top venues in my field, (e.g., [ACM CHI](https://sigchi.org/), [ACM ASSETS](https://dl.acm.org/conference/assets), [ACM UIST](https://dl.acm.org/conference/uist), etc.).

Outside of research, I'm a proud disability advocate. During my three years serving on the [National Association of Blind Students](https://nabslink.org/) board of directors, I traveled to 13 states across the country to host blind student empowerment seminars, help teach non-visual STEM and college readiness skills, and public speak about my own journey as a person with a disability. Every January, you can find me meeting with legislators on capital hill to advocate for important disability legislation, including the [Websites and Software Applications accessibility act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4998). I also co-founded and oversee an international mentorship program for young blind professionals in STEM.

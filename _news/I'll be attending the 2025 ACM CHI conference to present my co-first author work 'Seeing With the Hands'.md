While blind individuals like myself often rely on the sense of touch to interact with objects in the world, there are scenarios when perceiving the physical characteristics of an object at a distance (i.e. without first touching the object with the hands) is advantageous. Leveraging human-centered design, computer vision, and haptics, I collaborated with a team of researchers at UChicago's [Human-Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/) to try and enable human fingers to feel the properties of an object without actually touching them. I'll be demoing and presenting this work called "Seeing With the Hands: A sensory Substitution that Supports Manual Interactions" together with my authors [Shan-Yuan Teng](https://tengshanyuan.info/), (Xuanyou (Zed) Liu](https://xuanyouliu.com/), and [Pedro Lopes](https://plopes.org/) at the [2025 ACM CHI Conference](https://chi2025.acm.org/) in Yokohama, Japan. Read more about the project [here](https://seeingwiththehands.com/).

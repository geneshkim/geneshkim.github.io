It was an honor to speak at the [National Federation of the Blind in Computer Science Division's](https://nfb.org/about-us/divisions-committees-and-groups/divisions) annual seminar. I presented some old work on [machine embroidered tactile graphics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3559400.3565586) and my reflections/non-visual workflows as a blind researcher, engineer, and computer science student.

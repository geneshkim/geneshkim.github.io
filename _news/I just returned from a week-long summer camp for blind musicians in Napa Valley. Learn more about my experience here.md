Each year, [Enchanted Hills Camp for the Blind](https://lighthouse-sf.org/program/enchanted-hills-camp/) (a program of the [San Francisco LightHouse](https://lighthouse-sf.org) ) hosts a week long music camp. One of the highlights was a group assignment to write an original song in the key of A minor. My friends and I made this goofy tuneâ€”check it out on [YouTUbe!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjlUYv-ofoA)

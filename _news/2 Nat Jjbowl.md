So excited to share that my team (Chau Dang, Rebecca Yu, and I) just placed 3rd at the 2019 National Japan Bowl! This means we've secured a fully funded trip to Japan with the other top performers at this language, culture, and history competition. Thank you so much to Stefanie Fan, Irene Tsai, Julie Ye, and all the Japanese parents who helped us prepare!

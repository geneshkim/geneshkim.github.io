I just wrapped up my seventh consecutive National Federation of the Blind National Convention. I attended as a [scholarship winner](https://nfb.org/programs-services/scholarships-and-awards/scholarship-program) (see this year's winners [here](https://nfb.org/about-us/press-room/celebrating-outstanding-blind-students?fbclid=IwY2xjawMIurVleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFsNWZJQnFJWUlra0FXU1hCAR4GPP_O04NuIohBKXtf3qw_viHrVBxtB5jsccvMUtcirr7sFopopLA1NmwDpQ_aem_RhOihqAv6bzXp38cbIV7jg)) and was invited to speak on a variety of topics throughout the week, including a panel on how to involve non-student youth in disability advocacy organizations like the NFB. You can watch the panel [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/dySacOErJjs?si=H6_ZcuIcAa44QzFY&t=8172).

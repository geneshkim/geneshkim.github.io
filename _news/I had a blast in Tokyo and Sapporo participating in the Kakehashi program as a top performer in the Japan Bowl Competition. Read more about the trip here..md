Each year, about the top 10 teams (~30 people) that finish at the Level 4 competition at the National Japan Bowl earn a week-long cultural immersion trip to Japan. I had the opportunity to participate in a homestay program, tour a high school, take part in a traditional tea ceremony, meditate at a temple, go shopping in Harajuku, and even meet former First Lady Akie Abe and Princess Takamado. I've formed a lot of deep friendships too that I hope will last many years. I'm not particularly beautiful in these photos, but you can see some photos from the trip [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=lora.vaughan.10&set=a.129640724927248) or [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/search/keyword/?q=%23kakehashijb2019)

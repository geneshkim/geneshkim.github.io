In late July 2025, I was recognized by the [Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology (DO-IT) Center](https://doit.uw.edu) as a [2025 Trailblazer](https://doit.uw.edu/trailblazers/). This was a wonderful surprise as past Trailblazers include scholars and activists I have a tremendous amount of admiration for because of their leadership, character, and influential contributions to the disability community. My own work is motivated by the visual accessibility challenges I faced as a totally blind engineering student. I'm committed to developing tools and reshaping systems to ensure that everyone, regardless of ability, can fully enjoy the process of designing, building, and creating. Whether it's a digital data visualization or a physical interactive robot, the joy of making something should be accessible to everyone. Thank you to mentors like [Jennifer Mankoff](https://make4all.org/), [Sean Follmer]https://me.stanford.edu/people/sean-follmer), [Pedro Lopes](https://lab.plopes.org/), and [Megan Hofmann](https://www.megan-hofmann.com/) for pushing me to always do my best. I'm excited to keep working as I get ready to start my PhD with [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com/) and the [MIT Visualization Group](https://vis.csail.mit.edu/) soon!
